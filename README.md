## Features

- Cloning remote repositories (`git clone` and `git fetch`). Including shallow clone support (`--depth` option);
- Getting the list of references (branches, tags) in repositories;
- Checking out references (`git checkout`);
- Working with remotes (listing, renaming, setting urls);
- Committing local changes and pushing to a remote repository (`git commit` and `git push`);
- Getting log records for a repository (`git log`);
- Listing pending log records (committed locally, but not pushed yet) and upcoming log records (commited on a remote, but not presented in the working copy)
- Working with stashes (`git stash`);
- Basic merge (`git merge`);

`Git.framework` has no dependencies. Just clone and build.

## Requirements

- macOS 10.13+
- Xcode 10+
- Swift 4.2+
- Git for Mac 2.15+

## Installation

Before installing this framework, please make sure you're using the correct version of Git in your system. You can check the current version via Terminal app:

```
git --version
$ git version 2.15.1
```

### Carthage

To install Carthage you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Use the following command in Terminal app:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Git.framework into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "way-to-code/git-macOS" ~> 3.2.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Git.framework` into your Xcode project.

#### Swift 4.2

If you want to use `Git.framework` on **Xcode 10.1** or lower, please use version `1.5.1`

```ogdl
github "way-to-code/git-macOS" ~> 1.5.1
```

### Manually

You can install Git.framework manually. Clone the project locally, build and integrate to your project as a framework

### XCFramework

You may download XCFramework from the latests [release page](https://github.com/way-to-code/git-macOS/releases) and integrate it into your project.

Note that XCFramework support is available [since version 3.0.0](https://github.com/way-to-code/git-macOS/releases/tag/3.0.0).

### Swift Package dependency

When you want to use Git.framework as a dependency in other package, you may follow the given example:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    
    products: [
        .library(name: "myProduct", targets: ["myTarget"]),
    ],
    
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "Git",
                 url: "https://github.com/way-to-code/git-macOS.git",
                 .upToNextMajor(from: "3.2.0")),
    ],
    
    targets: [
        .target(name: "myTarget", dependencies: [
            .product(name: "Git", package: "Git")
        ]),
    ]
)
```

## Basics

## Quick examples

### Simple clone

To clone a remote repository you need to create an object **GitRepository**

```swift
let repository = GitRepository(fromUrl: URL(string: "https://github.com/github/hub.git"))
```
Next, just call the clone method

```swift
try? repository.clone(atPath: "/Users/youruser/hub")
```

### Providing credentials

You can specify credentials for repository with a help of **GitCredentialsProvider**. If no credentials are specified, credentials from the global macOS system git config are used by default.

```swift
let credentialsProvider = GitCredentialsProvider(username:"user", password:"****")
let repository = GitRepository(from: URL(string: "https://github.com/github/hub.git"), using: credentialsProvider)
```

### Receiving the progress 

You may keep track of the clone operation progress, by setting a delegate object on repository

```swift
let progressTracker = MyCustomObject()

let repository: GitRepository
repository.delegate = progressTracker

// implement RepositoryDelegate protocol in order to track the events
extension MyCustomObject: RepositoryDelegate {
func repository(_ repository: Repository, didProgressClone progress: String) {
}
}
```
